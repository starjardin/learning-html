          This is a new website for learning. I wondered if we could help each other by writing website and sharing what we have learned. This page is based on writing good html. I have been creating this website to help me and the other learners to learn about html and English. Before you write html, there are lots of things to know about it, read the following instructions. I am Andry Tantely (Honey). I am a student who is learning markup languages at Onja school in Madagascar. I have learned markup languages for two months.
